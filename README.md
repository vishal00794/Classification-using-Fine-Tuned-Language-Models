# Classification-using-Fine-Tuned-Language-Models
Built an SMS spam detection system using a pretrained LLM and a fine-tuned variant on a 4.7K labeled SMS dataset. The baseline (no fine-tuning) model achieved 86% accuracy, while fine-tuning improved performance to 91% accuracy on the same test set, demonstrating the impact of domain adaptation on text classification tasks.
